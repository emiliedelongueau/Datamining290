GRAPH1:
Order of nodes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

Adjacency list:
Graph1dict = {2:[], 3:[8,10], 5:[11], 7:[8,11], 8:[9], 9:[], 10:[],11:[2,9,10]}

Adjacency matrix:
Graph1matrix = 
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], 
[0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1],
[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0]]

GRAPH2:
Order of nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Adjacency list:
Graph2dict = {1:[2, 5], 2:[1, 3, 5], 3:[2, 4], 4:[3, 5, 6], 5:[1, 2, 4], 6:[4]}

Adjacency matrix:
Graph2matrix = 
[[0,1,0,0,1,0], 
[1,0,1,0,1,0],
[0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,1,0,1,1],
[1,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,1,0,0]]
