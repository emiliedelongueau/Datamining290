Question #5: What does ETL stand for?
ETL stands for "Extract, Load, Transform". It is a process used for a database usage,especially in data warehousing that:
- extracts data from outside sources
- transforms it to fit operational needs
- loads it into the end target (database, data warehouse)
ETL systems are commonly used to integrate data from multiple applications, typically developed and supported by different vendors. The disparate systems containing the original data 
are frequently managed and operated by different employees.
The extraction is the most challenging aspect of ETL

Question#10: What is information gain and how is it used to build decision trees?
When building a decision tree, we want to determine which attribute in a given set of training 
feature vectors is most useful for discriminating between the classes to be learned.
Information gain tells us how important a given attribute of the feature vector is.
It is used to decide the ordering/priority of attributes in the nodes of a decision tree.
Information gain : entropy(parent) - [average entropy(children)]
with entropy = SUM(-pi.log(pi)) where pi is probability of class i

To construct a decision tree, we choose the next attribute to use by selecting the one 
with highest information gain for the parent training set. 
And we iterate the same process for the child nodes.
Having a big information gain (low entropy fo child nodes) means that the samples have similar 
values and are homogeneous. If the sample is completely homogeneous, the entropy is zero and if
the sample is an eually divided it has entropy of one.
