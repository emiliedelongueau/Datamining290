# Multimedia Data Mining

---

## Features two_col:

  + Core algorithms similar to "traditional" data mining
  + Difference lies in feature engineering
  + How to translate intuitions to numbers and formulas?

<img src="img/face-recognition.jpg" width=100% />

---

## Types

  + Spatial: geographic points and features, including natural and man-made
    phenomenon
  + Images: Size, color, shape, curves, relative positions
  + Music: Tone, tempo, beat, rhythm
  + Voice: Speed, accent, word pauses, background noise

???

## Covering

  + We'll cover these areas briefly to get an overview of techniques used in
    these fields
  + All of these things *have* embedded information in them, and we are trying
    to extract it
  + One of the reasons data mining is not a black box: some one has to be on
    the outside interpreting results. Results inform technique

---

## Generalization two_col:

  + Many of these areas have digital representations
  + Can we use the raw bit representations?
  + Usually not: must generalize patterns

<img src="img/digits.png" width=100% />

???

## Density

  + The data we get from digital representations is generally too sparse
  + Key component of good learning is *data*, but you need fairly *dense* data
    to learn a pattern
  + Hypothetically, a neural network could extract general features from raw
    data, but you'd need a really large amount of data in order to get the
    density needed
  + Example: for NLP, perhaps your corpus is too sparse: not many words are
    shared between documents.  So instead generalize: what parts of speech or
    patterns show up across documents?

---

## Generalized Features

  + Derivative / Slope of behavior
  + Min / Max of groups of points
  + Bucketing / Blurring
  + Relative positions / angles

???

## Techniques

  + How can you strip some of the non-essential information, keep important
    patterns?
  + Many times we care about relative change, like in pricing
  + Or group data points together (clustering is an advanced form of this)
  + OK, let's get into some specifics:

---

## GIS two_col:

  + Geographic Information Systems
  + Analysis and visualization of geographic data
  + Search, terrain, object detection, flow calculations

<img src="img/gis.jpg" width=100% />

---

## Spatial Databases

  + Integrates spatial information with traditional DBMS operations
  + Spatial indexing, distance metrics, polygon definitions, layering
  + Eg: Oracle Spatial Data Cartridge, ESRI Spatial Engine

---

## Discovery

  + What are examples of efficient city layouts?
  + What influences successful business centers?
  + Deforestation rates

???

## Ideas

  + City layouts: Understanding home->work distances, not Euclidean, but
    traffic on streets or by public transportation, recognizing traffic jams
  + Business centers: analyzing network flow based on roads: industrial
    supply centers nearby?  Creative centers, restaurants, nightlife?
  + Deforestation: nearby cities' effect? Recognizing forested areas vs
    clear cut. Time series

## ATM Locations given obstacles center:

???

## Yelp

  + This is a current area we could improve at Yelp:
  + Just because you're a mile from a restaurant doesn't mean it is "close"
  + Maybe across the Bay, or maybe in between metro stops
  + How can you calculate efficiently?

---

## Images two_col:

  + General Feature Extraction
  + Sketch Recognition
  + Image Recognition

<img src="img/Sift_keypoints_filtering.jpg" width=100% />

???

## Covering

  + We'll cover some interesting ways to extract dimensions
  + ML/data mining combine these dimensions to do recognition with, eg.
    labeled data
  + Image on the right is using an algorithm to pick out, then filter
    "interesting" points on the image
  + img: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform

---

## SIFT

<img src="img/Sift_keypoints_filtering.jpg" width=100% />

???

## Process

  + Successively apply Gaussian blur to image
  + Find points which "stand out" between blurs (ie big differences)
  + You can connect these keypoints to make a kind of fingerprint
  + These fingerprints can be used, scaled, etc. to match against other images

---

## Sketch Recognition center:

<img src="img/sketch-1.png" width=100% />

+ Find (x,y) points along a sketch

???

## Why?

  + Sketch recognition can be used to see if you're drawing shapes
  + Be nice to be able to snap a picture of your diagram on a napkin and have
    it come out nicely formatted?
  + But how to recognize a circle, assuming you can't draw a perfect circle?
  + Start with (x,y) points, but as we mentioned, very sparse
  + Images by Marty Field

---

## Direction center:

<img src="img/sketch-2.png" width=100% />

+ Find angles along a sketch

???

## Angles?

  + Instead of points, measure the angle at each turn
  + You'll notice something peculiar about these angles. What?
  + They're more than +/- 180 because we want to continue a "trend" if
    they're turning the same way. Help identify changes in direction vs
    spirals

---

## Direction Plot center:

<img src="img/sketch-3.png" width=100% />

+ Plot angles vs time

???

## Why?

  + Becomes even more generalized:
    + What is the derivative?
    + How many times to we change derivatives?

---

## Direction Plot center:

<img src="img/sketch-4.png" width=100% />

+ Plot angles vs time

???

## Why?

  + Example where we change directions

---

## Features center:

<img src="img/sketch-4.png" width=100% />

+ NDDE: Normalized Distance between Direction Extremes
+ DCR: Direction Change Ratio

???

## Why?

  + NDDE: Are the discontinuous changes in direction, or is the line
    + generally curvy, and follows a similar path?
  + DCR: Total amount of angle change in the sketch. Low for first, high
    for second
  + Others?: bounding box size/ratio, stroke length, distance between endpoints,
    length, width, height, speed, direction, acceleration

## Music

  + Generate a finger print: time, frequency, amplitude
  + Filter most intense (largest) amplitudes
  + Create a hash of connections between points
  + Match, in time, the hash between songs

<img src="img/music_match.png" width=100% />

???

## Relation to Images

  + Interesting to note: we transformed one media type (music) into another
    (image), then started using some techniques we've seen in image
    fingerprinting
  + More in reading
